# Introduction

__SMART-HIRE-BOT__ : an application with an aim to automate the interview process.

Handling those job applications manually would need a significant amount of labour, time, and money. In addition, the HR personnel or the recruitment team must manually shortlist the incoming applicants and schedule interviews for them accordingly. This lengthy procedure makes the company's operations inefficient.
